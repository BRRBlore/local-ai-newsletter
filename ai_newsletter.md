### #2 [Arm will be @ PyTorch Conference, Join Us!](https://huggingface.co/blog/Arm/arm-at-pytorch-conference)

This text appears to be a transcript of an interview with David Mezzetti, a data scientist who participated in the CORD-19 challenge on Kaggle. The interview covers various aspects of his experience during the competition, including:

1. **Overview of the challenge**: Mezzetti explains that the CORD-19 challenge was unique because it involved working with a real-world problem, where there was no known answer.
2. **Methodology**: He discusses how he spent time on EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and exchanging ideas with other community members before building machine learning models.
3. **Tools used**: Mezzetti mentions that all the work was done on the Kaggle platform using CPU Notebooks, and development was done on a quad-core laptop with an 8GB GPU and 32GB of RAM.
4. **Hardware setup**: He notes that the fastText embeddings, study design models, and custom BERT QA models were built offline using his laptop.
5. **Run time for training and prediction**: Mezzetti estimates that it takes around 6 hours to fully ETL (Extract, Transform, Load), build the models, and run all the solution notebooks on Kaggle.
6. **Words of wisdom**: He shares insights gained from the competition, including the importance of iterative exploration, sharing feedback with experts, and building a workflow to solve the problem.

Some additional takeaways from the interview are:

* Mezzetti emphasizes the value of using data science for real-world problems and encourages readers to find projects that interest them.
* He stresses the significance of feature engineering and data preparation in data science.
* The interview highlights the importance of collaboration and sharing feedback with experts during a competition.

Overall, this interview provides valuable insights into David Mezzetti's experience participating in the CORD-19 challenge on Kaggle.
