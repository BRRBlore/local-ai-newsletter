### #2 [Arm will be @ PyTorch Conference, Join Us!](https://huggingface.co/blog/Arm/arm-at-pytorch-conference)

This is a long interview with David Mezzetti, a data scientist who participated in the Kaggle CORD-19 competition. The competition was organized to help address the COVID-19 pandemic by extracting insights from a large dataset of scientific articles related to SARS-CoV-2.

Here are some key points from the interview:

1. **Data preparation and feature engineering**: David emphasized that much of his time was spent on data preparation and feature engineering, which is often overlooked in machine learning competitions.
2. **Iterative approach**: He described an iterative process of exploring the data, sharing feedback with experts, and building a workflow to solve the problem.
3. **Collaboration**: David credited the success of the competition to the collaboration among data scientists, epidemiologists, and other experts who worked together to share ideas and build on each other's work.
4. **Use of pre-existing code**: He mentioned that he used pre-existing code from his previous project to get started with sentence embeddings, but would have explored different methods if starting over.
5. **Advice for new data scientists**: David advised that solving a problem you're interested in is the best way to learn data science, and emphasized the importance of data preparation and feature engineering.

Some technical details mentioned in the interview include:

1. **Tools used**: The competition was run on the Kaggle platform, using CPU Notebooks. Development was done on a quad-core laptop with an 8GB GPU and 32GB of RAM.
2. **Hardware setup**: David used a recurring job that runs each update (using kernelpipes) to fully ETL, build the models, and run all the solution notebooks on Kaggle.
3. **Model architecture**: He built a custom BERT QA model to extract answers from medical documents, using a question-answer dataset to teach the model how to answer medical questions.

Overall, this interview provides insights into the challenges and successes of participating in a large-scale machine learning competition, as well as practical advice for data scientists just starting out.
